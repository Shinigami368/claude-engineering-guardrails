# Skill: task-dispatcher

## Purpose
Classify a user request, choose the smallest correct skill or agent chain, and
identify the first step. This skill routes work; it does not implement tasks or
modify files.

## Trigger Conditions
Use this skill when:
- the request needs a non-trivial skill chain, agent route, or task-category decision
- the correct workflow depends on language, repo context, risk, or output type
- a narrower standalone skill is not already obviously sufficient

Skip this skill when the request matches the `NO-SKILL TASKS` section or when a
single standalone skill clearly owns the boundary.

## Step Order (Mandatory)
1. Decide whether the dispatcher should be skipped.
2. Estimate effort: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
3. Match the request to the closest task category.
4. Start from that category's `CORE` chain or direct-agent rule.
5. Add only the `CONDITIONAL` skills whose triggers are actually met.
6. Apply the always-on user rules and exclusions.
7. Return the route using the required output format.

## Routing Inputs
- user goal and requested output
- repo state, affected language or platform, and whether code already exists
- explicit risk factors such as auth, secrets, infra, browser/runtime, or multi-file scope
- whether the user asked for direct execution, a review, or a narrow standalone skill

## Routing Rules
- Prefer installed skills over freeform execution.
- If the request is ambiguous, ask before routing.
- Build the chain from `CORE` plus applicable `CONDITIONAL` skills. Never include the full list blindly.
- Read the decision criteria for each conditional skill before including it.

## Effort-Based Trim
- low (research, config diff, Q&A): no skills needed, skip dispatcher entirely.
- medium (single-file fix, small feature): `CORE` only, no conditional skills unless explicitly triggered.
- high (multi-file feature, new module): `CORE` plus the conditional skills whose triggers are met.

## Non-Goals
- Do not implement the task.
- Do not modify files.
- Do not include the full catalog blindly.
- Do not override explicit repo or user rules such as the no-`git-pr-packager` policy.

## USER RULES (always enforced)
- NEVER include git-pr-packager — user handles push/PR themselves.
- NEVER route to changelog or release-note automation in this repo unless the user explicitly changes the no-changelog policy.

- Tiny config lookups that do not change files
- Tiny memory/status lookups that do not need retrieval planning

## Evidence Expectations
- Base the route on explicit task cues, repo context, language or platform, and stated risk.
- When excluding a plausible skill, say why in `CONDITIONAL` or `EXCLUDED`.
- If the route depends on unresolved ambiguity, ask instead of forcing a category.

OUTPUT FORMAT

```
EFFORT: low | medium | high
TASK CATEGORY: [name]
CORE CHAIN: [ordered list — always runs]
CONDITIONAL: [skill → reason for inclusion] (or "none")
EXCLUDED: [skills skipped and why] (or "none")
START WITH: [first skill] — [reason]
```

DECISION RULES

1. Start with CORE. Only add CONDITIONAL skills whose trigger condition is met.
2. For Python tasks: self-check is mandatory. At least one review skill for high effort.
3. Never skip repo-navigator for tasks involving an existing codebase.
4. tdd-guide only if TDD is explicitly requested.
5. If effort is medium, do not add conditional skills unless the trigger is explicitly present in the request.
6. When in doubt about a conditional skill, leave it out — user can request it.
